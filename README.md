# Digital Inclusion For All
This project aims to provide digital literacy and access to PWDs and underserved communities, by offering online courses, mentorship and access to digital devices. The project envisions partnering with local and international NGOs, County Education departments, schools, and business to identify the needs and aspirations of the target groups, and design customized curricula and interventions. The project will also advocate for the rights and opportunities of PWDs and underserved communities in the digital economy and society.
